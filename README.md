# Ganadero-ProyectoUniversidad

This is a university project made by 3 students about cattle. </br>
You will be able to load all the information of your cows (breed, weight, color, vaccines...). In addition, you can upload tracking information (history of weights, vaccinations, diseases, behaviors). This information will be stored and then displayed in an orderly manner that allows you to analyze it and make decisions.
finally, you can export an excel with all this information.
